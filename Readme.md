# Single and Combined Traditional ML Models for Offensive Tweets Classification

As the internet era has interwoven into our daily lives, social media has become a ubiquitous tool for connecting with people. This surge comes with an escalation in offensive content on these platforms. Thus, identifying and alleviating offensive content becomes imperative. This paper explores various conventional machine learning models and their combinations, applying an optimized preprocessing pipeline to the dataset to enhance recall and precision in offensive tweet detection. Maximizing authentic offensive detections while minimizing false negatives is a paramount challenge in this domain. A structured preprocessing pipeline is applied to the dataset, guided by key dataset insights. Nine (Individual and Combined) conventional machine learning models were implemented with progressively increasing complexity to augment the model's efficacy. However, results indicate that increased complexity significantly impacts the various evaluation metrics. Thus, preprocessing and a balanced dataset are pivotal in offensive content detection.
